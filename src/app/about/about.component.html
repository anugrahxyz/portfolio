      <h3>Anugrah</h3>
      <h4>Project Manager & Software Engineer</h4>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Jakarta Raya, Indonesia</p>
      <p>
        Graduated from Brawijaya University in Computer Engineering (2022). During college,
        I realized the gap between academia and industry, which led me to upskill at Enigma Camp
        and eventually join Askrindo to build real-world applications.

        With a strong technical foundation, I transitioned into project management to lead dynamic teams that deliver outstanding digital solutions.
